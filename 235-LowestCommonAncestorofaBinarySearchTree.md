# Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
- Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.
- According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

## Recursion
runtime: O(n), space: O(n)
```python
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        # Traverse until p and q are in different side (one in left, the other in right)
        if p.val > root.val and q.val > root.val:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
        elif p.val < root.val and q.val < root.val:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        else:
            return root
