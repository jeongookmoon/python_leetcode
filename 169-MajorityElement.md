# Majority Element
- Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than âŒŠ n/2 âŒ‹ times.
- You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

### Note
* Majority element appears more than (size of array)/2 times

## Sort and get middle one
O(nlog(n))
```python
def majorityElement(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    nums.sort()
    return nums[len(nums)//2]
```
